 ---- getData.sh 
gets the users raw data from the server based on whether they have power information logged in the way Nexus 4 log its data. (Folders are transformed into 'Processing' folder)
It skips the users' folders which does not have this form of logging (The nexus 4 form). It unzips the power.gz file into 'power' for further analysis 


--- cleanBatteryDataLevelPluggedStatus.sh
Create 3 separate files per user for 
1- Level information (SOC)
2- Plugged information (whether plugged or not) 
3- Status information (charging, discharging, full, ... ) 
These files are in /processed/$userindex/ 
file name: $userindex.$chunkindex.$field


--- clean_data.py
A python script written by Paul. It puts the battery information in csv format to be used later in Matlab.
